Abstract:
This scientific report explores the application of machine learning techniques for intrusion detection in computer networks. With the increasing complexity and volume of cyber threats, traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) struggle to keep pace. Machine learning algorithms offer the potential to improve detection accuracy and scalability by automatically learning and adapting to evolving attack patterns. This report reviews the fundamental concepts of intrusion detection, examines various machine learning algorithms employed in the field, and discusses their effectiveness in detecting network intrusions. The findings highlight the strengths and limitations of machine learning-based IDS and provide insights into future directions for research and development.

1. Introduction:
Intrusion detection plays a critical role in safeguarding computer networks against unauthorized access and malicious activities. Traditional IDS rely on predefined rules and signatures, which often fail to detect sophisticated and emerging threats. Machine learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the effectiveness of intrusion detection by leveraging data-driven algorithms capable of learning and adapting to evolving attack patterns.

Machine learning-based IDS face several challenges, including the availability of labeled training data, interpretability of complex models, and the ability to handle adversarial attacks. This section highlights these challenges and suggests potential research directions, such as explainable AI, transfer learning, and adversarial robustness.

6. Conclusion:
Machine learning techniques have demonstrated great potential in improving the accuracy and scalability of intrusion detection in computer networks. By leveraging data-driven algorithms, machine learning-based IDS can adapt to emerging threats and detect previously unknown attacks. However, challenges related to data availability, model interpretability, and adversarial attacks need to be addressed to realize the full potential of these techniques. Continued research and development efforts are crucial to advancing the field of machine learning-based intrusion detection and enhancing the security of computer networks.
